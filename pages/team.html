                        I’m a senior double-majoring in Astronomy-Physics and Physics, with certificates in Math, German, and History. I first became involved with the magazine as a freshman, when I realized how much I missed writing with all of the science and math classes I was taking. I then spent a year as a Writing Head before stepping into this role as Co-Editor in Chief this year. I love being a part of the Wisconsin Engineer because of the leadership skills I have gained and the amazing outlet to write and help others improve their writing!

                        I’m a second year Mechanical Engineering student, and I picked up photography in  the summer leading into college. Since then, I’ve loved capturing cool, candid, and dynamic moments. I joined WEM in my first semester and became one of the Photography Heads this year. So far, I’ve been able to take photos of cars, planes, people, and more! I like WEM because I get to expand my photography skills, help others do so, and learn more about UW-Madison while doing it.
